# Luthien

Luthien is a WIP tool for generating color schemes and applying them to your system. It strives to produce beautiful color schemes and be highly extensible.

## Features

- Luthien produces "normal" color schemes suitable for use in any application, with generated colors of every hue. Many palette generation tools produce palettes which are mostly the same color; this is not the case with Luthien.
- Highly configurable plugin system which makes it easy to apply your themes to any application.
- Library of pre-made plugins for templating, terminals, and more.
